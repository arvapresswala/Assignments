##SWINGS
I have added sliders to the program, which affect the height of the birds.
I have a play and pause button which controls the music and birds.
I also added an input box where the answers will be entered. To enter the answer I have created a submit button.
If the answer is correct, a star appears. But if the answer is wrong, a message to try again and a restart button appears.
The restart button reloads the page.
The instruction button makes the music stop and the instructions appear on the page. When the instruction button is clicked again the page reloads.
I have moving clouds in the background for design.
The birds in the game move in sync with the amplitude and slider value.
